# Cough-Classification-for-COVID-19-Diagnosis
Cough sound analysis can often prove to be valuable in the diagnosis of respiratory and lung diseases. COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) has had devastating effects on humanity, making its early detection in patients an imperative measure for its treatment. Amongst many other symptom analyses, cough sound analysis has been revealed as a significant factor in diagnosing the virus. Applying the process of cough sound analysis for the initial assessment of COVID-19 in patients can be helpful as it is an entirely contactless way to the preliminary detection of the virus. In this study, the classification problem of COVID-19 diagnosis was dealt with by extracting the following features from the audio signals: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)(20 in number), Spectral Centroid, Zero-Crossing Rate, Chroma Frequencies, Spectral Roll-off. These extracted features were then used to train an Artificial Neural Network that has a sigmoid activation at the output layer making binary predictions.
